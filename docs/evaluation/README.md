# Evaluation and diagnostics

## Purpose

Evaluation measures forecast quality, optimizer parity and strategy value
without participating in battery decisions. Diagnostics explain data freshness,
model versions, readiness and failures without exposing private configuration.

## Non-authoritative boundary

Evaluation consumes immutable outputs and later matured actual slots. It may
write bounded reports, forecast observations, backtest results and command
traces. It cannot feed a live command, change a plan, retrain during a backtest
window or obtain an actuator reference. No duplicate forecast, optimizer or
compiler implementation remains at runtime.

## Metrics

Forecast evaluation treats load and PV independently and reports coverage, MAE,
bias, daily energy and lead-time buckets. Optimizer comparison reports action,
SoC, budget and cost deltas. Perfect-foresight replay is a diagnostic benchmark,
not a realizable live strategy.

Savings metrics must distinguish predicted value from measured battery flows.
Their units, price source and PV/export valuation must be explicit.

## Persistence and privacy

Evaluation stores compact bounded traces outside Home Assistant Recorder where
large attributes would harm recorder performance. Retention and file growth are
bounded. `command_trace.py` owns command-trace serialization and retention; the
live coordinator only schedules that observational write in the executor.
Public diagnostics redact configured entities, locations, credentials, device
identifiers and provider payloads.

## Setup independence

Metric definitions use contract fields and model identifiers, not household
names, addresses, hostnames, URLs, serial numbers or entity IDs. A report may
describe a supported device/provider class but must remain reproducible for any
installation supplying equivalent normalized inputs.

## Verification

Tests cover alignment, actual-data maturation, missing-data exclusion,
non-authoritative flags, retention, bounded attributes, redaction and failure
containment. A release gate must state its observation duration and numerical
tolerances before results are reviewed.

## Production status

Durable evaluation means explicit backtests, matured forecast metrics and
bounded command traces, not a dormant second implementation.
